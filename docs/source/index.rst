**Attention!** sRNA-workflow is now called miRPrusuit.
**This is still under construction.** But we are working hard to complete this page.

Brief description
-----------------
This is an open source project, developed by Forest biotech lab group `ITQB-NOVA<http://itqb.unl.pt>`_ . This is a workflow suited for running end-to-end analysis of sRNA data, from the raw data to produce annotated reads. You can execute this workflow parallely for all your libraries, ensuring that all libraries are treated in the same way. Thus providing a high degree of reproducibility in your analysis. The execution of this program produces a detailed documentation of all the parameters used, visible in the logging files. Another major feature is the high customizability of all the steps, which proves essential when working with non-model organisms.
