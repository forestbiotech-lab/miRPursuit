Brief description
-----------------
This is an open source project, developed at the Forest Biotech lab group `ITQB-NOVA <http://itqb.unl.pt>`_. miRPursuit is a pipeline suited for running end-to-end analysis of small RNA (sRNA) data, from the raw data to the annotated reads. You can execute this pipeline in parallel for all your libraries, ensuring that all libraries are treated in the same way, thus providing a high degree of reproducibility in your analysis. The execution of this program produces a detailed documentation of all the parameters used, visible in the logging files. Another major feature is that all the steps can be customized, making it particularly useful when working with non-model organisms.
