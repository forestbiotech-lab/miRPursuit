miRPursuit is an open source project developed by the `Forest biotech lab <http://www.itqb.unl.pt/research/plant-sciences/forest-biotech>`_ to automate the management of workloads in sRNA identification process.

Objectives

The main goal of this pipeline is to aggregate independent module into a pipeline to automate the process of extracting information from sequenced data.

Pros:

Data in these project is usally genarate in various libraries which have to be processed independantly   

Cons:


Outputs

Expression per lib
conseved sRNAs
novel 
tasi

Lists with statistics (What?)
Counts


Future goals:
