*Help and feature request*

 I'm glad to help you out, all feedback is valuable. Please open an `issue <https://github.com/forestbiotech-lab/miRPursuit/issues>`_ on the github project. This way you can see if it is something that has already been asked by others. I will respond in a as soon as possible. Opening issues also allows to set milestones and to include changes to the project to accomodate requests.
