*Help and feature request*

 I'm glad to help you out because all feedback is valueble but since time is scare. The best solution to provide help is to open an `issue <https://github.com/forestbiotech-lab/miRPursuit/issues>`_ on the github project. This way you can see if it's something that has already been asked by others. I promise I will respond in a timely fashion. Opening issues also allows me to set milestones and to include changes to the project to acomodate requests.
