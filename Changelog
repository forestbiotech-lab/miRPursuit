CHANGELOG v1.2

[miRProf] (TODO)
+(16/09/2016) Create empty file
  If there aren't any files create an empty cons file.
  [Problem for no results found with mirProf (Some species still don't have any)]
  Solved these errors:
	grep: .../sRNA/data/mirprof/lib01_filt-18_26_5_[gneome]_mirbase_srnas.fa: No such file or directory

	cp: impossível analisar '.../data/mirprof/lib01_filt-18_26_5_[genome]_mirbase_srnas.fa': No such file or directory
-(TODO) Deal with mismatches 
  Non redundant annotations by re running miRProf
  n order to perform the miRProf search without losing reads when allowing mismatches during searches, the workflow is designed using an interactive approach. Thus the first search is preformed using 0 mismatches and the annotated sequences are removed from the initial dataset. This dataset is used to perform a subsequent interaction by running with an increased number of mismatches and this process is repeated until the number of mismatches required is reached. The annotated sequences resulting from the individual runs are then grouped. The counting of the MiR families with sRNA sequences annotated in more than one miR family, are collapsed reporting the abundance of the multiply annotated sRNA sequence only once and avoiding redundant counting.

[Install] (Done)
+(16/09/2016)Changed path adding.
  Now the install script check which shell is being used and added to the proper startup file.
+(16/09/2016)Add mirbase file
  Was only adding the directory to config file.
-(TODO) Allow use of vars in prompt (Check if possible and inform in text)
  For bash this seams great. But what problems will this create in the long-term?
+(19/01/2017) fastqc
  Check if exists and install fastqc. In fastq or fasta depending on the input. If not installed it's not ran.
+(19/01/2017) Adding java to path if not installed
  If java isn't on the system the downloaded version will be added to the path.
-(TODO) Check if R exists
  Must install it if doesn't exist. Any version should do. At least for building the graphs. "Not feasible to install it. Either bring it along or "
-(TODO) Report build in LaTeX texlive-core and possibly bin have to be installed 400mb and 40mb respectivly. Must se how to do this seams big to generate a pdf. But some stripping might be possible. Another possiblility would be setting up a push server to produce PDFs. But might be over the top. Besides people wouldn't like it that much.
  
[Check before start] (Done)
+(16/09/2016)mirbase file
  Check the var in mirbase var is a file that exists (Only checking if var exists use -e or something man test)
+(20/09/2016) project dir empty
  Check if project dir is empty if not prompt if u want to continue
+(17/11/2016) Check libs exist
  Check whether the libs given by the numbers exist in the inserts dir. This avoids running with no libs causing a bunch of erros.
  https://github.com/forestbiotech-lab/miRPursuit/projects/1#card-843979

[Filter] (Done)
+(20/09/2016)If filtering leaves you with no sRNA should not continue for this library. No there's nothing to process.
  Will continue because other libraries might have interesting results. Only issue a warning.
+(17/11/2016) Filter suffix chose from varous definitions
  Copies params from the filter with the filter suffix in filters dir, into the wbench_filter_in_use.cfg. This config file is the one that will be used throughout the workflow.

[Genome] (DONE)
+(20/09/2016)Set up in a way that check weather there are any results from genome search
  Checks weather the output of genome filtering produces an empty file. If so a warning is issued to main window anouncing that, that libary produced no reads and that analysis of that library is over, but program will continue execution.
+(20/09/2016)Add parameters for genome filtering.
  Added patman_genome.cfg file to configs with all the different possible parameters that can be changed when filtering genome.
+(20/09/2016) Genome folder in project
  Changed the FILTER-Genome folder to something more uniform. filter_genome

[Logging] (TODO)
+(20/09/2016)This is terrible so many log files.
  Changing to master log file and folder with each subroutine (They are only copied to folder if run terminates with success)
+(20/09/2016)Saving logs with PPID
  Logs were being copied to the log folder by OK. in the file name. Now they are grouped by PPID. (This may still cause problems because PPIDs can still collide but it's very rare that this happens. Would only haven on multiple failed projects with restarts.)
+(20/09/2016) Added parameters of run in log.
  Parameters for every run are being stored in it's log file.
-(TODO) Logging for report.sh 
  is still lacking should be dealt with once unique report file output starts to be generated.
-(TODO) Add run parameter in logs
  Added the run parameters used in the begining of the file. [TODO for the rest of the logs]

[Parallel processing] (TODO)
-Update to dynamic parallel processing
  Currently the stack must finish running all subprocesses to start a new batch.
  With dyanamic parallel processing script could fork always the top number of processes as soon as on finishes.

[Phread score] (TODO)
-(TODO) Hardcoded phread score
  Must set a configuration file to ajust phread score.

[Document filtering](TODO)
-Point to how you can change filtering t/rRNA lists. 
  https://github.com/forestbiotech-lab/miRPursuit/projects/1#card-843974

[Config] (TODO)
+(17/11/2016) Config folder defauts
  Improve config files folder: Must come with defaults in folder
-(TODO) Not sure what is the issue
  Improve the guide explaining that this is not intended for single files but can be used that way. (Well)

[Send bug]
-(TODO) If bug send logs
  prompt and send if program doesn't finish properly

[README]
-(TODO) README to all folders
  Add readme to log folder explaining structure and others if they exist.

[Reporting]
-(TODO) Report file
  A general report file with a compilation of all the data generated. (Statistics and path to were results are.)
-(TODO) grep error no reads 
  Check which grep has problems with no reads. Looks like counts_merge.sh because of 90%. (Occurs when running dataset with trim option)
-(TODO) merge tables
  Run r script that merges all tables in counts

[email notification] (TODO)
-(TODO) Send email automatically
  When run is finished send email to responsible person.

[Screen printing] (TODO)
-(TODO) Ensure minimum printing to screen
  mircat is printing stuff to screen in server but now here why? (Version problem?)
  Not sure this is common problem

[Where to save] (TODO)
-(TODO)Project dir
  Instead of changing manually the workdir. Add it as a optional arg at start.
  Flag the workdir with color

[Trimming] (DONE)
+(18/11/2016) Set flag --trim to signal reads must be trimmed
  This is valid for all modes. Adaptor is in workdirs.cfg
  https://github.com/forestbiotech-lab/miRPursuit/projects/1#card-843951

[Headless] (DONE)  
+(20/01/2017) Add dummy X session.
  This allows miRPursuit to run headless. If Xvfb is installed.

[General] (TODO)
-(TODO) Skip run e create empty files 
  Don't run processes if input is empty. Just a wast of time. Simply check if file is empty
......

[Origin? - Solved with empty files (Test this)] 
ls: impossível aceder a '.../data/*_cons.fa': No such file or directory
[Problem trying to get all cons sequences]
[Solution upstream - Create empty file. If no results found]


[Report structure MD / Latex]
pandoc for MD --> PDF
Latex might be over the top.

After each step runs a script will we called to append the markdown. So the report isn't only build at the end.
Conversion to PDF happens at the end.

Tables only have lib# in columns and are limited to 10 columns or what ever fits.

  Fastq
    - Fastqc (For now just this one)
      Per base sequence quality
      *Per sequence GC content
      *Adapter Content
       
  Trimming
    - Detailed Log (Table?)
  Fasta
    - Size profiles
      One graph per lib. 
      Possible pair-wise comparison depending on lib number. (I think two at most)
  Filtering
    - Detailed report of filtering (Grab that log and build table)
  Genome
    - (How low details not sure has spot)
  End
    - Stats per lib (for each )
    - Counts per lib. (Issues with matrix size. Needs to be sized)
